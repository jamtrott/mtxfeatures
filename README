This is the README file for mtxfeatures, a program for computing
various features of sparse matrices in the Matrix Market file format.

Building
--------

The mtxfeatures programs can be built with `make'. Compilation and
linking may be configured through the environment variable `CC', which
is used to choose a compiler, and `CFLAGS' and `LDFLAGS', which are
used to set compiler flags and linker flags, respectively. Here is an
example:

     make CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native"

Usage
-----

mtxfeatures is used to load a matrix from a file in Matrix Market
format (see https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html), and
compute various matrix features, such as bandwidth and profile.

Some parts of these computations can use OpenMP for shared-memory
parallelism. In this case, the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS'
can be set to control the number of threads that are used. In
addition, `OMP_PROC_BIND' can be set to bind threads to particular
cores.

If the option `--verbose' is supplied, then some more information is
printed, such as how long time is spent loading the matrix and
computing matrix features.

Here is an example showing how to compute matrix features for the
matrix stored in the file test.mtx:

    $ ./mtxfeatures test.mtx  --verbose
    mtxfile_read: 0.000685 seconds (0.2 MB/s)
    csr_from_coo: 0.143457 seconds, 4 rows, 5 columns, 9 nonzeros, 1 to 5 nonzeros per row
    computing matrix features:
    rows: 4
    columns: 5
    nonzeros: 9
    minimum nonzeros per row: 1
    maximum nonzeros per row: 5
    mean nonzeros per row: 0.000
    standard deviation nonzeros per row: 2.688
    coefficient of variation nonzeros per row: 1.194
    done computing features in 0.027858 seconds

    $ make CC=gcc CFLAGS="-march=native -O3 -fopenmp"
